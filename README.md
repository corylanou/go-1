# Go Remote Meetups

## Kickoff a new Go remote meetup
If you want to present at our Go Remote Meetup, please head to our issue list to [open a new issue](https://github.com/remotemeetup/go/issues/new) and fill in all the information for the event.

Visit our [Remote Meetup Go](remotemeetup.golangbridge.org) channel to see a listing of past events for inspiration.

## Note about presenters
Every presenter for an event must be subscribed to the Remote Meetup Go channel here: remotemeetup.golangbridge.org. This is a pre-requisite for us to be able to connect an event to the presenter(s).

Keep in mind that attendees want to know about the presenter(s)'s' background, so include as much relevant info as possible. Please make sure that each presenter profile on our channel has most of these:
- Personal info: Full name, title, bio.
- Social media links: Twitter, linkedIn, Facebook.
