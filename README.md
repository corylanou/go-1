## Kickoff a new Go remote meetup
If you are a person who wants to organize a remote meetup, or someone who wants to do a tech-talk at one, please head to our issue list and [open a new issue](https://github.com/remotemeetup/go/issues). We get notified automatically and will get back to you soon after to help make your Go remote meetup happen.

We will include your event on our EventBright account [comming soon], on our website, help promote it, and help you with any technical tooling issue or question you might have.

## Guidelines

- Either an organizer or a speaker can kickoff a remote meetup.
