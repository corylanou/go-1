# Go Remote Meetups

## Kickoff a new Go remote meetup
If you want to present at our Go Remote Meetup, please head to our issue list to [open a new issue](https://github.com/remotemeetup/go/issues/new) and fill in all the information for the event.

Visit our [Remote Meetup Go](http://remotemeetup.golangbridge.org) channel to see a listing of past events for inspiration.

## Note about presenters
Every presenter for an event must be subscribed to the Remote Meetup Go channel here: http://remotemeetup.golangbridge.org. This is a pre-requisite for us to be able to connect an event to the presenter(s).  Also, be sure to run the [system check](https://www.bigmarker.com/system_check) before you get to the meetup on your laptop, as well as at the meetup to check your internet speed.
